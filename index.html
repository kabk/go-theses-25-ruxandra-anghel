            This thesis explores the concept of <em>mapping</em> as a means of
            reflecting human efforts to comprehend and structure the world,
            emphasizing its significance in shaping our perception of reality
            and memory. Mapping is presented as both a cognitive and creative
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            While cartography plays a fundamental role in how we navigate and
            make sense of our surroundings, mapping also involves the
            organization, interpretation, and understanding of experiences,
            memory, and space.
          </p>
          <p>
            The power of maps becomes apparent when looking at visual
            representations of the world, whether digital or analog. However,
            alternative methodologies of mapping allow us to escape constructed
            realities challenging conventional notions of spatial perception.

			<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Looking through my work from the past four years, I notice a slow but
        steady evolution in my approach—a growing understanding of what I once
        thought was impossible to explain: my process of thinking. I have often
        found myself caught between two worlds, that of a designer and that of
        an artist. This in-between state has shaped my perspective, making me
        question the necessity of verbalizing what I see and create.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in mapping is not something I consciously chose; rather, it
        is something that has always been present, woven into my way of
        understanding the world. To explore this, I find it essential to trace
        it back in time, both to my early life and my journey within design.
        Through my graphic design studies, I have gained tools to articulate
        ideas, but while reflecting on my work I repeatedly encounter a
        pattern—a subconscious obsession with making associations, categorizing,
        and structuring my surroundings. Perhaps this stems from a fear of chaos
        or a response to past criticism, but regardless of the reason, it has
        led me toward a deep affinity for visual arts and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter what I look at, my mind begins mapping connections. My thought
        process is an ongoing navigation through references, ideas, and images.
        This way of thinking is not new to me. As a child, I would play a game
        with my grandmother, searching for faces and shapes in the patterns of
        floor tiles, narrating the figures we imagined. Without realizing it,
        this simple game trained my visual memory, sharpening my ability to find
        meaning in abstract forms. In many ways, this early habit mirrored the
        essence of mapping—assigning meaning, navigating through fragmented
        visuals, and constructing an understanding of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But mapping is not just a personal exercise, it is a fundamental human
        behavior. We map our surroundings, our experiences, and even our
        identities. Mapping is an attempt to make sense of reality, yet reality
        itself is a relative concept—one that is shaped by our positionality,
        perceptions, and biases. No map is neutral. Every representation of
        space, whether physical or digital, is an abstraction, a selective
        interpretation shaped by those who create it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This raises interesting questions: How do we engage in this essential
        habit while navigating a reality that is inherently constructed? What
        happens when those assigned to create meaning—whether through physical
        maps or digital platforms—impose their beliefs; and how does this
        influence our collective memory and understanding of place?
      </p>
      <p>
        This thesis aims to examine how mapping functions as a method of
        control, and a way of preserving memory and knowledge. By analyzing
        different forms of mapping, I aim to demonstrate how it shapes our
        perception of the world—revealing both its limitations and its power.

      <p>
        The world was nothing but one large unknown territory until we
        discovered the means to draw its terrain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The act of mapping reflects our human need to categorize, interpret, and
        communicate information, becoming an exercise of control—an attempt to
        impose structure on an otherwise chaotic reality. It is ingrained in
        human nature to seek order, make connections, and share meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the first step in this exploration is to define the term
        <em>map</em> etymologically. Understanding its meaning will provide a
        foundation for examining <em>mapping</em> as a broader conceptual, and
        creative act.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word <em>map</em> derives from the Latin <em>mappa,</em> meaning a
        napkin or a cloth.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        I believe this could suggest that map-making started
        somehow as a commodity that could come in handy to anybody happening to
        ­have something to write on. It emphasizes the subjectivity aspect of
        such a practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the 9<sup>th</sup> century, the term <em>mappa mundi</em> could be used to
        describe a representation of the known world, either pictorial or verbal
        text. ­The term’s evolution stems from late antique surveyors who
        recorded their designs on cloth.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        the materiality of maps and their role in human civilization as a tool

        Early attempts to visually structure knowledge in the medieval period,
        are illustrated in manuscripts such as <em>Macrobius’s Commentary on the Dream of Scipio</em> and the diagrams
        in <em>Isidore of Seville’s De Natura Rerum</em>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        William Harris Stahl, New York: Columbia University Press, 1952; Isidore of Seville, <em>De
        Natura Rerum</em>, edited by Jacque Fontaine, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1960.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Macrobius’s Commentary on the Dream of Scipio</em> presents a
        cosmological vision that blends philosophy with cartographic
        representation. He divides the world into five climatic zones, only two
        of which are habitable, emphasizing a structured and hierarchical
        understanding of space <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Figs. 1, 2]</strong>. This approach to mapping
        reflects the way dreams and celestial journeys offer insight into higher
        knowledge, as well as the positionality of its creator in space and
        time. By depicting both the physical world and the dream realm,
        <em>Macrobius</em>’s map suggests that understanding reality requires
        navigating both the seen and the unseen, a concept that resonates with
        the subjective nature of mapping itself.

              This diagram depicts the five “circles
              of the world”, arranged like the
              petals of a flower (Stevens 1980, p.
              274). The five circles set around a
              smaller circle represent the different
              climatic zones of the Earth: the
              northern- and southernmost circles
              as well as the middle circle are
              denoted as inhabitable, while the

        The diagrams in <em>Isidore of Seville’s De Natura Rerum</em> (On the nature of
        things) reflect a schematic rather than a geographic representation of
        space, dividing the world into three parts: Asia, Europe, and Africa. It
        combined the study of time with cosmography and meteorology to provide a
        general overview of the natural world. Through his work, Isidore
        demonstrated how mapping was as much about shaping perception as it was
        about depicting reality <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Fig. 3]</strong>. The fact that medieval diagrams were
        infused with Christian symbols shows that while they were based on
        classical models, they were also changed to fit a new Christian view of
        the world <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Fig. 4]</strong>.

        >Aristotle, <em>On the Heavens</em>, translated by Jonathan Barnes, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998.<br><br>
        Aristotle believed the Earth was round based on several key observations. He noted that
        during a lunar eclipse, the Earth casts a circular shadow on the Moon, indicating a spherical
        shape. He also observed that different Stars are visible in different regions of the Earth,
        suggesting curvature. He also pointed out that ships dissapear from the view hull as they
        sail away, which supports the idea of a curved surface. Philosophically, Aristotle considered
        the sphere to be the most perfect shape, reinforcing his beliefs in a round Earth.</span>

        but my interpretation is that this is the proof that knowledge is circular. It
        is what makes our existence meaningful, with Earth as our common ground.
        Mapping the world is what makes us humans. What goes around comes
        around. We all have the same natural instinct of trying to fill the gaps
        in our understanding of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at all these examples we can speculate that humans are somehow
        self-centered. Every collective knowledge or memory is centered around
        its creators. I think there is nothing actually objective in this world
        since the theoretical one was created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maps, in this sense, are visual aids that are not just neutral
        depictions of space but deliberate interpretations of reality,
        influenced by the intentions, biases, and limitations of their creators,
        leading to countless interpretations of the same reality.

        This issue of perspective is central to mapping. <em>The Ambassadors</em>, by
        Hans Holbein <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Figs. 6, 7]</strong>, explores perspective and the hereditary

        and so on, emphasizing the importance of perspective and the objects

        Encyclopedia Britannica, May 12, 2023.<br><br>
        Anamorphosis, in the visual arts, is an ingenious perspective technique that gives a distorted
        image of the subject, represented in a picture, when seen from the usual viewpoint,
        but so executed that if viewed from a particular angle, or reflected in a curved mirror, the
        distortion disappears, and the image in the picture appears normal.</span>

        zone in which the entire image goes all
        wrong. When viewers move around the painting to the side, this zone
        transforms into the image of a skull. Holbein challenges us to consider
        the pointlessness of both wealth and status, as well as the nature of
        perspective. Both are doomed to formlessness, ultimately leading to the
        skull and, by extension, to death, because they do not represent the
        absolute truth, since there is no such a thing in map-making.
        Highlighting its significance, this painting draws attention to how
        maps, as representations of space, can shape our understanding of power
        structures hinting that wealth, although ephemeral,  is a key element in
        the production of knowledge.

        The standard world map used nowadays, exists since 1569
        <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Fig. 8]</strong>, despite its distortion of the Earth’s surface, where
        the size of Greenland looks bigger than Africa— which is not really
        accurate.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        Widely used because, aside from navigation, it is well suited for
        internet web maps, the <em>Mercator Projection</em> isn’t wrong, it’s
        just fundamentally impossible to represent the surface of a sphere on a
        flat piece of paper without distorting something. This projection
        sacrifices the accurate depiction of areas between different latitudes,
        in order to accurately depict shapes. It allows straight lines on a flat
        paper, to correspond to curved lines of constant bearing on a globe.
        This is extremely useful for navigation because you can draw a straight
        line from your current position to your destination and it corresponds
        to the curved path you’ll take. <em>Mercator projection</em> allows the
        full space of a rectangular sheet of paper to be taken up without empty
        space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Map projections are obviously meant to claim the space around,
        showcasing knowledge and its limitations. As professor Shannon Mattern
        describes, Medieval and Rennaissance map-makers were illustrating the
        limits of their explorations through mythical sea creatures.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        Based on Aristotle’s <em>Horror vacui</em> theory, which states that nature has a

        Why was it necessary to add all these drawings, instead of accepting the
        void? At first glance, I thought the cartographic representation would
        still be the same without them but these monsters served as
        <em>interfaces between the known and the unknown</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        Shannon Mattern continues explaining that while this practice creates
        disorientation, it also becomes a political tool, quoting the
        postcolonial literary Scholar, Isabel Hofmeyr, who reminded us that
        <em>the myth of the empty sea is largely the product of European
        imperialism, and their map-making traditions in which the sea becomes
        blank space across which power can be projected.</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        This fear of emptiness leads me to believe that humans are
        conquerors by nature, so in order to construct nothingness, we have to
        relate it to what is already there.
      </p>
      <p>
        If maps are not just representations of space, but also tools of power,
        imagination, and projection, then what happens when they are wrong?
        Erroneous knowledge can become embedded in collective consciousness
        supporting the idea that maps are as much about imagination as they are
        about accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as medieval map makers filled the unknown with mythical creatures
        <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Fig. 11]</strong>, throughout history the concept of phantom islands has
        been a popular error among early days cartographers. For instance, when
        the early Spanish explorers landed the extraordinary lenght of what we
        know as the Gulf of California, in the 1600s, they never made it all the
        way up to the connection of the top, and made the understandable
        assumption that California was an island.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"
        ><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label
        ><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote"
        >YouTube, <em>Phantom Islands: The Lost Isles of History</em>, uploaded by Atlas Pro, August 8, 2020.</span> 
        
        This error persisted on thousands of maps of the newly discovered continent
        <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Figs. 12, 13]</strong>, right up until the end of 18<sup>th</sup> century, because
        people wanted it to exist. It was named after the fictional island of
        California, from a popular 16<sup>th</sup> century romantic novel about an island
        inhabited entirely by Amazonian women.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"
        ><label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label
        ><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote"
        >Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, <em>Las sergas de Esplandián</em>, 1510.</span>
        
        In an era where European high society was using maps for decoration rather than navigation, it made
        artistic, if not geographic sense to include the famous island, the
        well-read thing that people wanted to see. This suggests that maps were
        not just practical instruments but also cultural artifacts influenced by
        what people wanted to believe in rather than what was true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the mythical island of Brasil, from Irish folklore,
        exemplifies how legends influenced early cartography. Brasil was an
        island forever cloaked in mist but that could be seen just for one day
        every seven years. It first appeared on maps in 1325, a time when
        inaccuracies were seen as a reasonable hazard of cartography, and
        distinguishing myth from reality was a low priority.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"
        ><label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label
        ><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote"
        >YouTube, <em>Phantom Islands: The Lost Isles of History</em>, uploaded by Atlas Pro, August 8, 2020.</span>

        The inclusion of such fantastical places underscores how early mapmakers often
        intertwined imagination with exploration, further blurring the lines
        between the known and the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maps reveal their dual nature as both practical tools and cultural
        artifacts. These inherent limitations of cartography underscore how
        representations of space are influenced by the perspectives and desires
        of their creators. From Holbei’s, <em>The Ambassadors</em>, which
        critiques the illusions of wealth and status, to the enduring myths of
        phantom Islands we see that maps serve not only to navigate the physical
        world but also to reflect and shape our collective imagination.

			  These glitches construct glimpses into fragmented worlds, where being
			  mapped and digitally visible is a privilege in itself. Most of the
			  images collected are from regions where access to tools like Street View
			  can be limited. This digital divide makes me question not only how
			  places are seen, but also who gets to be seen and remembered in our
			  mapped world.
			</p>
			<p>
			  What I meant by who gets seen or not is about the imbalance in how the
			  world is documented. Some areas are thoroughly mapped and constantly
			  updated, while others are barely visible or only partially represented
			  on global platforms. This visibility gap often reflects broader
			  inequalities, where wealthier regions are more digitally accessible and
			  represented than less privileged ones. Distortion isn’t just visual, but
			  is tied to deeper issues of representation and erasure.

			<p>
			  Maps become reflections of the societies that produce them, and they are
			  used to organize space and, by extension, people. They are increasingly
			  democratized through open data and platforms like Google Maps. The issue
			  is no longer access to information but its organization. The open-source
			  movement has transformed how we use maps. They are no longer static—they
			  are living tools that evolve as we interact with them, unfolding new
			  stories and perspectives. As an example, I would like to mention the
			  Golf of Mexic, on Google Maps, which after different disputes and
			  debates with the new government of the US, had its name changed to The
			  Golf of America <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Fig. 18]</strong>. This, deliberately or not, supports
			  the idea that open-source maps are tools for political discourse where
			  positionality becomes an important aspect of map making suppressing
			  knowledge and power.

        Maps are always an abstraction of the physical or conceptual world while
        also representing a symbolic depiction of a space or ideas. This allows
        one to understand and navigate more or less unfamiliar places or
        experiences.

        Just as maps help us navigate physical space, memory allows us to
        navigate personal and collective histories. Our minds create internal

        Memory, in its essence, involves forgetting. Mapping
        serves as a way to preserve memory—an attempt to trace what exists so
        that it won’t fade away.

        The Situationist movement resonates with this exploration because it
        uses maps to express personal, subjective realities of urban spaces
        while challenging traditional notions of mapping and place. Their
        approach to culture and art was influenced by this attitude of revolt
        toward collective knowledge, of space, and the study of the
        subconscious. It was also influenced by the Surrealist movement of the
        early 20<sup>th</sup> century <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[Fig. 21]</strong>, which pushed the bounds of art by
        examining the illogical and unconscious components of human experience.
        The Situationist movement had its emphasis on psychogeography and the
        emotional experience of space.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        The concept of psychogeographical maps refers to the study of how urban
        and physical environments affect human behavior, feelings, and
        experiences. This name combines the physical and social features of
        locations, with a <em>psycho</em>, referring to the mind. The aim is to
        see the city in a fresh, unfiltered way, free from the limitations of
        maps, routines, and predetermined paths. According to this theory, what
        may appear random is a subconscious response to how the city’s
        infrastructure and politics impact our lives.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        Guy Debord described psychogeography as;
        <em>the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the
        geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the
        emotions and behavior of individuals.</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        Bureau of Public Secrets, 1955.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This eventually connects to perceiving the city as not a collection of
        utilitarian spaces, but a labyrinth of experiences filled with hidden
        meanings and discoveries. The same spaces might reveal themselves
        differently for different people inhabiting them, adding to the
        multi-layered and multi-sensorial nature of space.

        <em> Separation is itself part of the unity of the world, of the global
          social praxis split up into reality and image. The social practice
          that the autonomous spectacle confronts is also the real totality
          mutilated to the point of making the spectacle appear as its goal. The
          language of the spectacle consists of signs of the ruling production,
          which at the same time are the ultimate goal of this production.</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"

      </p>
      <p>
        The spectacle isn’t just a distraction but an integral part of how
        society functions — separating reality and image while making that
        separation seem like the goal itself. Debord’s concept of the spectacle
        describes how signage in urban spaces becomes ornamental, detached from
        its original function, and part of a larger system of mediated
        perception. Images function as maps that dissolve into mere
        representations —abstractions of the world. However, this abstraction is
        subjective. For the creator, the image retains meaning, but for others,
        it exists as a detached interpretation. We become attached to the
        meanings we assign to things because they help us make sense of the
        world. Yet, in doing so, we experience a form of alienation — our
        reality is not fixed but continuously shaped by individual perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>...this reciprocal alienation is the essence and the support of the
        existing society</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"

        This rather artistic movement or reinterpretation of traditional
        cartography allows a more personal, non-literal exploration of space. It
        challenges the expectations we have of maps, encouraging us to think of
        them not only as tools for navigation, but as complex, multifaceted
        representations of memory, identity, and emotions.

      <p>
        As Nicholas Mirzoeff explains, the way we see the world is deeply
        intertwined with reality and what we have accessible around us.
        Everything that is, in any way, possible to describe, label, or
        categorize is connected to society. No matter where we go, we carry our
        pre-constructed reality with us, analyzing everything through that
        lens.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"
        ><label for="sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label
        ><input type="checkbox" id="sn-27" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote"

      </p>
      <p>
        It’s like a visual regime that regulates what we see, and ironically,
        the regime is constructed by us. Visuality is at the very center of
        struggles for social justice, at moments of both domination and
        resistance. It highlights that how we see and understand the world
        through images, symbols, and visual culture can influence both
        oppression and resistance. In moments of domination, visuals can be used
        to control narratives and reinforce power structures. Conversely, during
        resistance, visuality can be a powerful tool for mobilization, raising
        awareness, and challenging dominant narratives. Essentially, visuality
        is a key element in the dynamics of power, shaping how social justice
        issues are understood and addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many examples of recontextualization of meaning, especially in
        mapping, such as Batia Suter’s book entitled
        <em>Parallel Encyclopedia</em>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"
        ><label for="sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label
        ><input type="checkbox" id="sn-28" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote"
        >Batia Suter, <em>Parallel Encyclopedia</em>, Zurich: JRP|Ringier, 2014.</span>
        
        Images acquire new significance and
        emotional resonance when presented in novel juxtapositions. They are
        recontextualized to a point that they gain new meaning assuming new
        associative values. I think it is very interesting to browse this book
        and analyze what goes on in someone’s brain. My first instinct is to try
        to find connections between the images although they are organized in a
        rather unusual manner. <strong style="color: #f49a9a;">[ Figs. 23 ]</strong>

        All of this culminates in a fear of nothingness — the fear of being
        unable to explain what surrounds us, which leaves us feeling powerless.
        To break from the world means to take a break from trying to constantly
        update and progress our meaning of reality.

          <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        Mapping is far more than a technical exercise—it is a deeply human
        activity, reflecting our desires, biases, and limitations. Whether in
        traditional cartography, digital navigation, or abstract conceptual
        diagrams, maps shape our understanding of the world, reinforcing
        existing structures or challenging conventional perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        By recognizing the inherent subjectivity of mapping, we gain a deeper
        awareness of how reality itself is constructed, mediated, and contested.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, map-making—far from fixing reality—becomes a wild
        proliferation of alternative ones, of possible worlds, each as faulty
        and fantastic as the next. And yet, explicitly or not, all maps carry a
        certain claim: that this one is somehow truer than the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, after presenting all these different approaches, it becomes
        easier to state that there are countless ways of perceiving and
        representing the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mapping, at its core, is image-making. This becomes intertwined with my
        practice as a graphic designer, and because of this, I take part
        directly in the production of knowledge. A designer has to be in charge
        of the viewer's mind and always make informed design choices. The
        information represented visually influences others, dictating what the
        focus should be on, and what should remain unseen. My goal was not to
        dismiss the credibility of what maps mean and transmit, but to invite
        people to question what they see and, to raise a kind of awareness that
        helps us to not take everything for granted.
