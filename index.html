				<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

					<p>	This thesis explores the concept of <em>mapping</em> as a means of reflecting
						human efforts to comprehend and structure the world,
						emphasizing its significance in shaping our perception of reality
						and memory. Mapping is presented as both a cognitive and
						creative process.</p>

					<p>	While cartography plays a fundamental role in how we navigate
						and make sense of our surroundings, mapping also involves
						the organization, interpretation, and understanding of experiences,
						memory, and space.</p>
						
					<p>	The power of maps becomes apparent when looking at visual
						representations of the world, whether digital or analog.
						However, alternative methodologies of mapping allow us to
						escape constructed realities challenging conventional notions
						of spatial perception.</p>

			<div class="text-box6">
				<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

					<p>	Looking through my work from the past four years, I notice a
						slow but steady evolution in my approach—a growing understanding
						of what I once thought was impossible to explain: my
						process of thinking. I have often found myself caught between
						two worlds, that of a designer and that of an artist. This in-between
						state has shaped my perspective, making me question
						the necessity of verbalizing what I see and create.</p>
					
					<p>	My interest in mapping is not something I consciously chose;
						rather, it is something that has always been present, woven
						into my way of understanding the world. To explore this, I find
						it essential to trace it back in time, both to my early life and my
						journey within design. Through my graphic design studies, I
						have gained tools to articulate ideas, but while reflecting on my
						work I repeatedly encounter a pattern—a subconscious obsession
						with making associations, categorizing, and structuring
						my surroundings. Perhaps this stems from a fear of chaos or a
						response to past criticism, but regardless of the reason, it has
						led me toward a deep affinity for visual arts and design.</p>
					
					<p>	No matter what I look at, my mind begins mapping connections.
						My thought process is an ongoing navigation through
						references, ideas, and images. This way of thinking is not new
						to me. As a child, I would play a game with my grandmother,
						searching for faces and shapes in the patterns of floor tiles,
						narrating the figures we imagined. Without realizing it, this
						simple game trained my visual memory, sharpening my ability
						to find meaning in abstract forms. In many ways, this early
						habit mirrored the essence of mapping—assigning meaning,
						navigating through fragmented visuals, and constructing an
						understanding of the world.</p>

					<p>	But mapping is not just a personal exercise, it is a fundamental
						human behavior. We map our surroundings, our experiences,
						and even our identities. Mapping is an attempt to make sense
						of reality, yet reality itself is a relative concept—one that is
						shaped by our positionality, perceptions, and biases. No map
						is neutral. Every representation of space, whether physical or
						digital, is an abstraction, a selective interpretation shaped by
						those who create it.</p>

					<p>	This raises interesting questions: How do we engage in this
						essential habit while navigating a reality that is inherently
						constructed? What happens when those assigned to create
						meaning—whether through physical maps or digital platforms—
						impose their beliefs; and how does this influence our
						collective memory and understanding of place?</p>

					<p>	This thesis aims to examine how mapping functions as a method
						of control, and a way of preserving memory and knowledge.
						By analyzing different forms of mapping, I aim to demonstrate
						how it shapes our perception of the world—revealing both its
						limitations and its power.</p>

					<h3>The Circular Paradigm</h3>

					<p>	The world was nothing but one large unknown territory until
						we discovered the means to draw its terrain.</p>
						
					<p>	The act of mapping reflects our human need to categorize, interpret,
						and communicate information, becoming an exercise
						of control—an attempt to impose structure on an otherwise
						chaotic reality. It is ingrained in human nature to seek order,
						make connections, and share meaning.</p>	 

					<p>	I think the first step in this exploration is to define the term
						<em>map</em> etymologically. Understanding its meaning will provide
						a foundation for examining <em>mapping</em> as a broader conceptual,
						and creative act.</p>

					<p>	The word <em>map</em> derives from the Latin <em>mappa</em>, meaning a napkin
						or a cloth.
					<sup>
						<label for="footnote1" class="footnote-link"><strong>[1]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						I believe this could suggest that map-making started
						somehow as a commodity that could come in handy to anybody
						happening to have something to write on. It emphasizes
						the subjectivity aspect of such a practice.</p>

					</div>

					<p>	By the 9th century, the term <em>mappa mundi</em> could be used to
						describe a representation of the known world, either pictorial
						or verbal text. The term’s evolution stems from late antique
						surveyors who recorded their designs on cloth.

					</div>

					<p>	<em>Macrobius’s Commentary on the Dream of Scipio</em> presents a
						cosmological vision that blends philosophy with cartographic
						representation. He divides the world into five climatic zones,
						only two of which are habitable, emphasizing a structured and
						hierarchical understanding of space <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Figs. 1, 2]</span>. This approach to
						mapping reflects the way dreams and celestial journeys offer
						insight into higher knowledge, as well as the positionality of
						its creator in space and time. By depicting both the physical
						world and the dream realm, <em>Macrobius’s</em> map suggests that understanding
						reality requires navigating both the seen and the
						unseen, a concept that resonates with the subjective nature
						of mapping itself.</p>

					<p>	The diagrams in <em>Isidore of Seville’s De Natura Rerum</em> (On the
						nature of things) reflect a schematic rather than a geographic
						representation of space, dividing the world into three parts:
						Asia, Europe, and Africa. It combined the study of time with
						cosmography and meteorology to provide a general overview
						of the natural world. Through his work, Isidore demonstrated
						how mapping was as much about shaping perception as it was
						about depicting reality <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Fig. 3]</span>. The fact that medieval diagrams
						were infused with Christian symbols shows that while they
						were based on classical models, they were also changed to fit

					<p>	All diagrams illustrated in the manuscripts, although two centuries
						apart, 
					<sup>
							<label for="footnote4" class="footnote-link"><strong>[4]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						have something in common when it comes to
						depicting knowledge about the universe: circularity. In fact,
						<em>De Natura Rerum</em> was often called <em>Liber rotarum</em> after its distinctive
						<em>rotae</em>, the circular shape of the diagrams.
					<sup>
							<label for="footnote5" class="footnote-link"><strong>[5]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						Perhaps this
						could be explained by Greek philosophers’ theories
					<sup>
							<label for="footnote6" class="footnote-link"><strong>[6]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						or even the Mesopotamian flat earth beliefs,
					<sup>
							<label for="footnote7" class="footnote-link"><strong>[7]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						but my interpretation is that
						this is the proof that knowledge is circular. It is what makes
						our existence meaningful, with Earth as our common ground.
						Mapping the world is what makes us humans. What goes
						around comes around. We all have the same natural instinct
						of trying to fill the gaps in our understanding of the world.</p>

					<h3>Navigating Perspectives</h3>

					<p>	<em>The analogy between a map and a piece of paper reveals the
						inherent limitations of maps in representing the world. A map,
						being a projection, can never fully replicate the physical world.
						It is impossible for a flat sheet of paper to accurately rest on a
						globe, and therefore, no map can ever be 100% accurate. Maps
						are not neutral; they are projections, which in themselves are
						not natural or given. They are always influenced by the perspectives
						and priorities of the mapmakers.</em>

   					<h4><strong>[8]</strong> Hans Ulrich Obrist, <em>Mapping It Out: An Alternative Atlas of Contemporary Cartographies</em>,

					</div>

					<p>	This issue of perspective is central to mapping. <em>The Ambassadors</em>,
						by Hans Holbein <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Figs. 6, 7]</span>, explores perspective and the hereditary
						distortion in representing reality. In his famous painting,
						two statesmen stand surrounded by cartographic tools,
						globes, a quadrant, and so on, emphasizing the importance of
						perspective and the objects that define how we understand
						the world. The space between the two men, on the carpet, is
						an anamorphic
					<sup>
						<label for="footnote9" class="footnote-link"><strong>[9]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						zone in which the entire image goes all wrong.
						When viewers move around the painting to the side, this zone
						transforms into the image of a skull. Holbein challenges us to
						consider the pointlessness of both wealth and status, as well
						as the nature of perspective. Both are doomed to formlessness,
						ultimately leading to the skull and, by extension, to death, because
						they do not represent the absolute truth, since there is
						no such a thing in map-making. Highlighting its significance,
						this painting draws attention to how maps, as representations
						of space, can shape our understanding of power structures
						hinting that wealth, although ephemeral, is a key element in
						the production of knowledge.</p>

						the <em>Mercator Projection</em> isn’t
						wrong, it’s just fundamentally impossible to represent the
						surface of a sphere on a flat piece of paper without distorting
						something. This projection sacrifices the accurate depiction of
						areas between different latitudes, in order to accurately depict
						shapes. It allows straight lines on a flat paper, to correspond to
						curved lines of constant bearing on a globe. This is extremely
						useful for navigation because you can draw a straight line from

						the curved path you’ll take. <em>Mercator projection</em> allows the full

						creates disorientation, it also becomes a political tool, quoting
						the postcolonial literary Scholar, Isabel Hofmeyr, who reminded
						us that <em>the myth of the empty sea is largely the product
						of European imperialism, and their map-making traditions in
						which the sea becomes blank space across which power can
						be projected</em>.
						<sup>
							<label for="footnote14" class="footnote-link"><strong>[14]</strong></label>
						</sup>
						This fear of emptiness leads me to believe that
						humans are conquerors by nature, so in order to construct
						nothingness, we have to relate it to what is already there.

					<p>	If maps are not just representations
						of space, but
						also tools of power, imagination,
						and projection,
						then what happens when
						they are wrong? Erroneous
						knowledge can become embedded
						in collective consciousness

						are about accuracy.</p>

					<p>	Just as medieval map makers filled the unknown with mythical
						creatures <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Fig. 11]</span>, throughout history the concept of phantom islands
						has been a popular error among early days cartographers.
						For instance, when the early Spanish explorers landed the extraordinary
						lenght of what we know as the Gulf of California,
						in the 1600s, they never made it all the way up to the connection
						of the top, and made the understandable assumption that
						California was an island.
					<sup>
						<label for="footnote15" class="footnote-link"><strong>[15]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						This error persisted on thousands
						of maps of the newly discovered continent <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Figs. 12, 13]</span>, right up
						until the end of 18<sup>th</sup> century, because people wanted it to exist.
						It was named after the fictional island of California, from a
						popular 16<sup>th</sup> century romantic novel about an island inhabited
						entirely by Amazonian women.
					<sup>
						<label for="footnote16" class="footnote-link"><strong>[16]</strong></label>
					</sup>
						In an era where European high
						society was using maps for decoration rather than navigation,
						it made artistic, if not geographic sense to include the famous
						island, the well-read thing that people wanted to see. This suggests
						that maps were not just practical instruments but also
						cultural artifacts influenced by what people wanted to believe
						in rather than what was true.</p>

					<h3>The Illusion of Objectivity within Digital Territories</h3>

					<p>	I have always enjoyed expanding my archive of visual references
						by exploring open sources and collecting anything I find
						interesting or possibly useful for my artistic practice. My curiosity,
						combined with the ease of accessibility, always brought
						me to new visual discoveries. I am particularly intrigued by exploring
						unfamiliar places; however, financial limitations often
						prevent me from traveling.</p>

					<p>	Although satellite technology might mark the death of discovery
						— as new areal images can be used to perfectly map almost
						every inch of the world— I would consider that these actually
						represented the birth of a new era, rather than the death of
						discovery — an era of accessibility. For the past few years, I’ve
						been collecting screenshots of my findings from the Street
						View option, on Google Maps, as well as images uploaded by
						the community members in the review section. Initially, I saw
						them as merely amusing, but their depiction of space slowly
						sparked deeper questions in my mind. I have noticed a lot of
						places appearing glitched, transforming supposedly familiar
						landscapes into distortion. It gives me the feeling that I am
						actually exploring a distorted imaginary map, instead of an
						<em>accurate</em> depiction of the world <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Figs. 14]</span>.</p>

						<figure class="mobile-only"><img class="fig14" src="../boilerplate-with-css/assets/images/Screenshot (911).png">

						</figure>


					<p>	These glitches construct glimpses into fragmented worlds,
						where being mapped and digitally visible is a privilege in itself.
						Most of the images collected are from regions where access to tools like Street View can be limited. This digital divide makes
						me question not only how places are seen, but also who gets
						to be seen and remembered in our mapped world.</p>	

					<p>	What I meant by who gets seen or not is about the imbalance
						in how the world is documented. Some areas are thoroughly
						mapped and constantly updated, while others are barely visible
						or only partially represented on global platforms. This visibility
						gap often reflects broader inequalities, where wealthier regions
						are more digitally accessible and represented than less privileged
						ones. Distortion isn’t just visual, but is tied to deeper
						issues of representation and erasure.</p>	

					<p>	Maps become reflections of the societies that produce them,
						and they are used to organize space and, by extension, people.
						They are increasingly democratized through open data and platforms
						like Google Maps. The issue is no longer access to information
						but its organization. The open-source movement has
						transformed how we use maps. They are no longer static—they
						are living tools that evolve as we interact with them, unfolding
						new stories and perspectives. As an example, I would like to
						mention the Golf of Mexic, on Google Maps, which after different
						disputes and debates with the new government of the
						US, had its name changed to The Golf of America <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Fig. 15]</span>. This,
						deliberately or not, supports the idea that open-source maps
						are tools for political discourse where positionality becomes
						an important aspect of map making suppressing knowledge
						and power.</p>

					<p>	Being used to a Western cartographic representation, with
						Europe depicted as the center of the world does not mean that
						this should be considered as the absolute truth. This urge for
						standardization of maps is, therefore, particularly evident in
						modern digital mapping technologies, where algorithms shape
						our perception of space and reality. Chinese maps <span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Fig. 16]</span>, for instance,

						on China, with accurate proportions of the surroundings.

					<p>	The concept of psychogeographical maps refers to the study of
						how urban and physical environments affect human behavior,
						feelings, and experiences. This name combines the physical
						and social features of locations, with a psycho, referring to the
						mind. The aim is to see the city in a fresh, unfiltered way, free
						from the limitations of maps, routines, and predetermined
						paths. According to this theory, what may appear random is a subconscious response to how the city’s infrastructure and
						politics impact our lives.

						creator, the image retains meaning, but for others, it exists as a
						detached interpretation. We become attached to the meanings
						we assign to things because they help us make sense of the

					<h3>Recontextualizing reality</h3>

					<p>	As Nicholas Mirzoeff explains, the way we see the world is
						deeply intertwined with reality and what we have accessible

					<p>	It’s like a visual regime that regulates what we see, and ironically,
						the regime is constructed by us. Visuality is at the very

						and resistance. It highlights that how we see and understand
						the world through images, symbols, and visual culture
						can influence both oppression and resistance. In moments of
						domination, visuals can be used to control narratives and reinforce
						power structures. Conversely, during resistance, visuality
						can be a powerful tool for mobilization, raising awareness, and
						challenging dominant narratives. Essentially, visuality is a key
						element in the dynamics of power, shaping how social justice
						issues are understood and addressed.</p>

						Images acquire new significance and
						emotional resonance when presented in novel juxtapositions.
						They are recontextualized to a point that they gain new meaning
						assuming new associative values. I think it is very interesting
						to browse this book and analyze what goes on in someone’s
						brain. My first instinct is to try to find connections between
						the images although they are organised in a rather unusual
						manner.<br><span style="color:rgb(255, 24, 24);">[Fig. 20]</span></p>

					<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
				
					<p>	Mapping is far more than a technical exercise—it is a deeply
						human activity, reflecting our desires, biases, and limitations.
						Whether in traditional cartography, digital navigation, or abstract
						conceptual diagrams, maps shape our understanding of
						the world, reinforcing existing structures or challenging conventional
						perspectives.
					</p>

					<p>	By recognizing the inherent subjectivity of mapping, we gain
						a deeper awareness of how reality itself is constructed, mediated,
						and contested.
					</p>

					<p>	In an instant, map-making—far from fixing reality—becomes a
						wild proliferation of alternative ones, of possible worlds, each
						as faulty and fantastic as the next. And yet, explicitly or not,
						all maps carry a certain claim: that this one is somehow truer
						than the others.
					</p>

					<p>	Nonetheless, after presenting all these different approaches,
						it becomes easier to state that there are countless ways of perceiving
						and representing the world.
					</p>

					<p>	Mapping, at its core, is image-making. This becomes intertwined
						with my practice as a graphic designer, and because
						of this, I take part directly in the production of knowledge. A
						designer has to be in charge of the viewer's mind and always
						make informed design choices. The information represented
						visually influences others, dictating what the focus should be
						on, and what should remain unseen. My goal was not to dismiss
						the credibility of what maps mean and transmit, but to
						invite people to question what they see and, to raise a kind of
						awareness that helps us to not take everything for granted.
